# Larkator : ARK Dino Finder
> Reads your ARK. Finds your dinos.

### What is is?
Need help locating your next high-stat tame for better dino breeding?
Larkator uses your ARK save file to help you locate both wild and tamed creatures.

### Features
 - Find both wild and tamed creatures
 - Filter based on species, gender, min and max levels
 - Show the results on a map with full coordinates
 - Helps you find your lost tames
 - Creature stats are shown to help you find that elusive next tame
 - Automatically re-reads your save file when it changes
 - Supports all six of the standard ARK maps

### Requirements
Larkator needs access to read your .ark save file to do its work. This works best for local saves but also works if you can fetch
the save file via FTP or other service (which you'd do manually), but if you don't have access to this file I'm afraid you are out
of luck.

### Installation
For full step-by-step installation instructions refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/coldino/Larkator/wiki/Installation).

### Use and Tips
 - Select a filter on the left side of the window to show a map of the results. Details of the results are show on the right.
 - **Use your mouse's scroll wheel** over a search filter's gender and level selector to change them.
 - To add a new species click the big add button. Set a category name, the species and any other filters you would like then click add.
 - **Filters can be dragged** around in the list to re-order or change categories.
 - While ingame, use the command `saveworld` to force the game to save - Larkator will update immediately
 - Locate that max-level Quetzal and go get it!
